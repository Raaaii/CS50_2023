Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
With a small number of simulations time is shorter, however for 100 simulations it is longer than for 1000 simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations.
